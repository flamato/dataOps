# SDR3 Ingest Pipeline / DataDevops SDR3 Work Cycle

*(proposal being written)*

There are three converging areas of need in this proposal. One is having a devOps / dataOps work cycle to continue to build out analysis and work around data API-forward architecture for DLSS, setting up & documenting server-less infrastructure leveraging AWS, and consolidating analysis on the current state and desired shifts of our existing infrastructure in terms of operations, data systems, and software/codebases. The second area is to pull together and push forward analysis of SDR3 requirements outside of the Hydrox demo, then matching that with design and at least one major example of a portion of SDR architecture and infrastructure migrated to a data-forward, API-reliant and cloud-based codebase. The third is the currently on hold reset of the Google Books accessioning pipeline, which requires a full rewrite of its current ingest and accessioning processes into SDR. Due to its size (over 2 million digital books) and backlog status, the Google books accessioning pipeline is an ideal candidate for a test of purpose and design of the first two work areas.

## Goals:

- interview infrastructure practitioners on current pain points on current infrastructure
- compile list of lessons learned
- compile specs on deliverables required for current accessioning needs
- explore a data oriented, event driven architecture to process some data object that we currently accession via the SDR ‘pipeline’
- Google books accessioning?
- build a proof of concept in AWS to vet the said architecture
- Generate a set of conceptual diagrams and documentation of concerns approached and wireframe a strategic plan for migration to said infrastructure
